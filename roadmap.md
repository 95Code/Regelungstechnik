# Roadmap for Regelungstechnik

## Project Overview

This project contains the following subprojects:

- `Limbo` Python module `regelungstechnik`
    - `Done` Create and evaluate transfer functions
    - `Limbo` Evaluate the impulse response of a transfer function
    - `Done` Plot bode diagramms
    - `Limbo` Plot step responses
    - `ToDo` Plot responses to arbitrary input functions
- `ToDo` Website
    - `ToDo` GUI interface to the python module `regelungstechnik`
- `ToDo` YouTube
    - `ToDo` Explainatory videos on the basic transfer functions

If something is `Done`, it is a stabel version that doesn't need immediate attention. If something is in `Limbo`, it is currently worked on. The objective is to have as few things as possible in `Limbo`. If something is `ToDo` it is a wish for the future, but no actual work has been put into it.

## My Next Objective

*Figure out the impulse response of a general PT2 transfer function.*
