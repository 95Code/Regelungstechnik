# Roadmap for Regelungstechnik

## Project Overview

This project contains the following subprojects:

- `Done` Create and evaluate transfer functions
- `Limbo` Evaluate the impulse response of a transfer function
- `Done` Plot bode diagramms
- `Limbo` Plot step responses
- `ToDo` Plot responses to arbitrary input functions
- `ToDo` Website as GUI
- `ToDo` Videos as explanations

If something is `Done`, it is a stabel version that doesn't need immediate attention. If something is in `Limbo`, it is currently worked on. The objective is to have as few things as possible in `Limbo`. If something is `ToDo` it is a wish for the future, but no actual work has been put into it.

## My Next Objective

*Refactor transfer functions into basic elements that return transfer function or impulse response.*

- `Done` Figure out the impulse response of a general PT2 transfer function.
